// OO Challenge
// Part One
// Create a class for vehicle. Each vehicle instance should have the following properties:

// make
// model
// year
// Each vehicle instance should have access to a method called honk, which returns the string “Beep.”

// let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
// myFirstVehicle.honk(); // "Beep."
// Each vehicle instance should have a method called toString, which returns the string containing the make, model and year.

// let myFirstVehicle = new Vehicle("Honda", "Monster Truck", 1999);
// myFirstVehicle.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Honda Monster Truck from 1999."

class Vehicle {
    constructor (a, b, c){
        this.make = a;
        this.model = b;
        this.year = c;

        honk(){
            return "Beep."
        }
        toString(){
            return `The vehicle is a ${this.a} ${this.b} from ${this.c}.`
        }
    }
}



// Part Two
// Create a class for a car. The Car class should inherit from Vehicle and each car instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 4.

// let myFirstCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2005);
// myFirstCar.toString(); // "The vehicle is a Toyota Corolla from 2005."
// myFirstCar.honk();     // "Beep."
// myFirstCar.numWheels;  // 4

class Car extends Vehicle {
    super (a, b, c);
    this.numWheels = 4;
}


// Part Three
// Create a class for a Motorcycle. This class should inherit from Vehicle and each motorcycle instance should have a property called numWheels which has a value of 2. It should also have a revEngine method which returns “VROOM!!!”

// let myFirstMotorcycle = new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000);

// myFirstMotorcycle.toString();
// // "The vehicle is a Honda Nighthawk from 2000."

// myFirstMotorcycle.honk();     // "Beep."
// myFirstMotorcycle.revEngine(); // "VROOM!!!"
// myFirstMotorcycle.numWheels;  // 2

class Motorcycle extends Vehicle {
    super (a, b, c);
    this.numWheels = 2;
    revEngine(){
        return "VROOM!!!";
    }
}



// Part Four
// Create a class for a Garage. It should have a property called vehicles which will store an array of vehicles, and a property called capacity which is a number indicating how many vehicles will fit in the garage. When you create a garage, vehicles will always be empty; you only need to provide the capacity.

// A garage should also have an add method, which attempts to add a vehicle to the array of vehicles. However, if you try to add something which is not a vehicle, the garage should return the message “Only vehicles are allowed in here!”. Also, if the garage is at capacity, it should say “Sorry, we’re full.”

// let garage = new Garage(2);
// garage.vehicles; // []
// garage.add(new Car("Hyundai", "Elantra", 2015)); // "Vehicle added!"
// garage.vehicles; // [Car]
// garage.add("Taco"); // "Only vehicles are allowed in here!"

// garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2000));
// // "Vehicle added!"
// garage.vehicles; // [Car, Motorcycle]

// garage.add(new Motorcycle("Honda", "Nighthawk", 2001));
// // "Sorry, we're full."


class Garage {
    constructor(capacity) {
      this.vehicles = [];
      this.capacity = capacity;
    }
    add(newVehicle) {
        if (!(newVehicle of Vehicle)) { //What is the difference between instanceOf and of in a for of loop?
          return "Only vehicles are allowed in here!";
        }
        if (this.vehicles.length >= this.capacity) {
          return "Sorry, we're full.";
        }
        this.vehicles.push(newVehicle);
        return "Vehicle added!";
      }
    }
